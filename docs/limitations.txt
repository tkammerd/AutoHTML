Mergefields and Sections cannot be placed within HTML tokens, such as
inside tags.

Mergefields and Sections currently don't work well between <TITLE> and
</TITLE>.  They work, but the title still shows the comments.

When pages are generated and later accessed, they often are retrieved from
cache, so that the old version is displayed, even though the page has
changed.  Maybe there is a way to invalidate the cache upon regeneration
(without forcing reload every time the page is used!)
