    <H3>Requirements:</H3>
    The program should:
    <OL>    
      <LI>RequiredElement
      <LI>RequiredElement
      <LI>RequiredElement
    </OL>              
    <P>
    Follow the <A HREF="/~tkammerd/style_guide.html">programming style
    and documentation rules</A> given in class (and posted on the class
    web page). Failure to do so will result in significant loss of credit.
    <P>
    Your answers should be typed using a plain text editor,
    such as emacs or notepad, and stored in a file called assign1.txt.  If you need 
    illustrations, you should save them as a bmp, gif, png, or jpeg file (gif, png, or jpeg
    is preferred) named figure#.bmp, figure#.gif, figure#.png, or figure#.jpg and refer to
    the figure in your answer (so for instance, a gif illustration for figure 2 would be 
    stored in figure2.gif).  Such graphics should be created using a drawing program -- NOT 
    with a scanned freehand drawing!  HTML format is preferred for the whole thing, if you 
    know how, but it is not required.  If you do use HTML, your answers will be in a file 
    called assign1.html, instead of assign1.txt.

    <P>
    <H3>Testing Plan:</H3>
    Adequate testing of this program requires various sets of data.  Turn
    in a typed report of your testing (see below). Be sure to test every 
    possible path in the logic flow of the program.

    <P>
    <H3>What to turn in: </H3>
    <UL>
      <LI>A typed report of the test data you used to test your program.
          For each test, you should show:
          <UL TYPE="square">
            <LI>A description of the situation you were testing for
            <LI>The input data used for the test
            <LI>A description the results from the test, and <U>why</U>
                they were judged satisfactory.
          </UL>
      <LI>Submit your program electronically on Shaman before the due date
          given below.  Your submission should include:
          <UL>
            <LI>a file containing your testing report named prog0_test.txt
            <LI>a file containing the source code named prog0.cpp
          </UL>
          After copying this file into your csci200_work/submission
          directory, submit it using the command:<BR>
          <TT>submit csci000 assign0</TT>
      <LI>Please follow these instructions carefully for full credit.  
          Programs with syntax errors will receive no credit.
    </UL>

    <P>
    <H3>What to turn in: </H3>
    Copy assign0.txt (or assign0.html) and any illustration files into your submission
    directory.  Make sure that the text file is readable using the "less" pager (or in a
    web browser if it is HTML).  Also, please check to make sure your illustration files
    are not corrupt before you submit! (I recommend copying the files into your public_html
    directory and attempting to view them with a browser.) Then submit it all with:
    <P>
    <TT>submit csci000 assign0</TT>
    <P>
    Make sure you copy these files -- don't just move them, because the submission system will
    remove the contents of the submission directory!

    <P>
    <H3>Due Date: </H3>
    Beginning of class, DayOfWeek, Month 00, 2002.
