                There will be 5 Hands-On
                Projects, or HOP's.  Each HOP is a step-by-step exercise
                which reinforces one or more areas of study, and must be
                performed hands-on a personal computer (loaded with the
                appropriate software).  A short quiz will accompany each 
                HOP, which you must take outside of class.  You may obtain
                and take the quiz during my office hours.  You are welcome
                to use any personal computer to which you have access, but
                we can only guarantee that the Windows 95 computers in the
                Computer Science Dept. Laboratory (Hanna 238B) will be 
                properly configured for success.  Each HOP is assigned on 
                a Monday (see schedule) and is due by the beginning of class,
                the second Monday following (so you have 2 weeks).

                an area of study, or to prepare for a topic.  However many
                are given, they will be averaged together to form the grade
                for "Other Assignments".

                There is no attendance requirement
                for graduate students.  However, regular attendance is essential
                for success in this class.  Undergraduates are required to 
                attend 90% of all classes, and a higher standard is expected 
                from graduate students. Note that excessive unexcused absences
                for undergraduates are considered 10% of the total classes, 
                which for this semester and class is two (2) classes.  If your 
                attendance is poor, it will be reported to your dean, and you 
                may be asked to leave the class, for your own good.  Attendance 
                may not be taken every day (though it will be taken on most days),
                but the days on which it <B><U>is</U></B> taken will be used to
                calculate a statistical average to be used for your Participation
                grade. Every student is responsible for anything covered in class,
                even if it is not in the text.  This includes announcements of 
                assignments or test dates, so if forced to miss class, be sure to
                contact the instructor and ask to be informed of that day's 
                content.  Please remember that we only meet 14 times before the 
                final (each class represents over a full week!), so even if you 
                cannot attend the whole class on some occasion, try to attend 
                some of it.

                Even though the class only meets 
                once per week, you <B>must</B> participate in it more often than
                that.  This is a full semester course, and I am available to you
                more often than once per week.  You must check the class web 
                page for updates or additions on a regular basis, at least 3 
                times per week, and break your class workload up in the same way.
                It is <U><B>absolutely not acceptable</B></U> (and destined for
                failure) to only give consideration to the assignments or the 
                class itself on Monday.  A good schedule would be to set aside a
                couple of hours 3 times per week, say Tuesday, Thursday, and 
                Saturday (just a suggestion).

                Most of your time in this class is
                not spent in the classroom.  You should be prepared to spend a 
                significant portion of time outside of class for every hour 
                spent in class.  Traditional rules of thumb suggest that 3 
                hours outside of class for every hour spent in class is 
                reasonable.  The actual time spent varies from student to 
                student, but suffice it to say that you will <B>NOT</B> complete
                course requirements through attendance alone.

                If you suspect a class cancellation

                at 342-1856.  If there is a cancellation, my voice mail
                will reflect that fact within 2 hours of class time (sooner
                if possible).  If no message, assume that class will be
                held.  I will also try to put a notice on the class web
                page.  I will normally be in class on time.  If I am not,
                you should wait at least 15 minutes before leaving, and
                someone should check my office to make sure I am not there.
                If I am unavoidably detained, I will normally call and have
                the class instructed to either wait, or go home.

              This course will consist primarily of interactive lectures with
              assignments to reinforce major points of discussion.  Assignments
              may be done in our lab, or alternatively in another campus lab or
              on your home computer (if adequately configured).  Be aware that
              our computing facilities are limited, and if you wait until the last
              minute to do your assignments, you may be unable to get adequate
              resources.  Grading assignments by students in the class provides
              an opportunity for quick feedback, as well as improved cohort
              support and class discussions.

              The Internet is used extensively as a communications tool in this
              class.  Announcements, copies of assignments, a copy of this 
              syllabus, and various examples and data files will be available on
              the class page on the World Wide Web.  Students are expected to print
              their own copies of assignments and lab handouts from the class 
              website, should they need hard copy.  Announcements of a time
              critical nature may be emailed to class members.  Class discussions
              and questions may be pursued on the class web-based discussion forum.

              reading assignments may come from web-based resources, not just the
              required texts.  Students should be aware that they will be tested
              over the contents of their reading and class handouts, as well as
              lecture topics.  Some things will be in the text but not in the
              lecture, others will be in the lecture but not in the book.  Both
              parts are necessary for success in this class.

              There will be 2 tests to assess individual  understanding of the
              material presented.  These tests will be spaced in a relatively even
              fashion throughout the semester, a midterm and a final exam.  Both
              tests will have equal weight, and the final exam is not cumulative
              (although any test may require understanding of previous concepts,
              simply because of the dependence of one topic upon another).  Tests
              will normally be returned within one week of the test date during the
              semester.

            Learning is a social experience, and I wouldn't dream of trying
            to change that.  Studying with friends, and talking among
            yourselves about how to attack a problem is important to
            success in this class.  But if you don't do your own thinking
            -- if you only take from these discussions, and never give --
            then you won't understand well enough to perform on tests.
            That's enough to trash your grade in this class.  Make sure
            that your work is your own, because you might have to pass a
            quiz over the content of your assignment to receive credit.  If
            a project is supposed to be done by a group, it will be

            please come see me.  I try to be as accessible as I know how.
            If you can't make my office hours, drop by anyway -- if I'm not
            covered up with something, I'll be glad to work with you.  And
            if we need to, we can make a special appointment.  And remember
            that you can always leave me a phone message or use email.
