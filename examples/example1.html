    <P><B>Description</B>: <!-- ##MERGEFIELD## description --!>Computers are powerful tools for processing large 
      quantities of data. Yet, the power of the computer does not come from 
      its ability to do highly intuitive and expressive processes but rather 
      from the computer ability to do simple processing fast and accurately.  
      By doing a simple task repeatedly, computers present the illusion of 
      powerful processing. It is with this in mind that we discuss and use 
      loop structures. One of the common loop structures found in the C 
      programming language is the <I>for</I> loop. The <I>for</I> loop is 
      characterized as a self-incrementing loop that contains both an 
      initialization and a terminating condition within the same structure. 
      This assignment will have you work with the <I>for</I> loop in several       
      different situations.<!-- ##/MERGEFIELD## --!>

        <!-- ##MERGEFIELD## problem_txt --!>Write a program that will prompt the user for a 
        set of five numbers. Then read the five numbers and calculate the 
        average of the value entered. The program must use a <I>for</I> loop 
        to read the values from the user. The program must contain only one 
        read statement.<!-- ##/MERGEFIELD## --!>
      <!-- ##/SECTION## --!>
      <LI><B>Problem 2</B>: Modify the program from problem 1 so that the user 
        is prompted for the number of values he will be entering. This will 
        require the introduction of variable comparisons in the loop 
        condition.  The program terminates after reading a single set of 
        numbers and printing the average of the numbers entered.
      <LI><B>Problem 3</B>: Modify the program from problem 2 so that the user 
        can enter three different sets of numbers calculating the average for 
        each set. Remember each set can contain a different number of values. 
        Again, a <I>for</I> loop must be used to repeat the process all three 
        times.

      include a hard copy of your well documented code with all appropriate        
      header, a print out of an execution of the program and a disk labeled 
      with your name that contains a soft copy of your program both an 
      executable and source file solution.<!-- ##/MERGEFIELD## --!></P>
