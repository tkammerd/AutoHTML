# AutoHTML
Templating system for class websites

AutoHTML is a templating system in HTML, CGI, and Perl (over 2700 lines of code)
for maintaining consistent course websites. It is basically a crude 
learning/content management system. Note that at this time, learning management
systems were in their infancy, and not widely adopted or well-known (WebCT and
CourseInfo, which became BlackBoard, were started in 1997).
